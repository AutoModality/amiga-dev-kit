# amiga-dev-kit
Welcome to the Amiga Development Kit ([documentation here](https://farm-ng.github.io/amiga-dev-kit/)), a toolset of hardware and software built by farm-ng to help farmers, hackers, engineers, roboticists, or anyone with a vision the ability to skip the 2 years and millions of dollars we spent in the mud prototyping, debugging, testing, bleeding, crying, grinding, and engineering... that it took to create a low-cost, ruggedized, and waterproof outdoor platform with which we and others can begin to help small farms, and the wider challenge of producing and distributing food more sustainably and profitably.       

We are actively creating this page and will be updating it eminently (written 2022.08.24 - 5:15pm)  - Thanks for your patience as we begin untangling the past two years of our work into a human-legible text and images, to share these tools and ecosystem with you.  

Warm Regards, - Matthew Bitterman, Co-founder, farm-ng
